Welcome to Rietveld
-------------------

This project shows how to create a somewhat substantial web application
using Django on Google App Engine.  It requires Django version 1.0.

In addition, I hope it will serve as a practical tool for the Python
developer community, and hopefully for other open source
communities. As I've learned over the last two years at Google, where
I developed a similar tool named Mondrian, proper code review habits
can really improve the quality of a code base, and good tools for code
review will improve developers' life.

Some code in this project was derived from Mondrian, but this is not
the full Mondrian tool.

Running
-------

To run the app locally (e.g. for testing), download the Google App
Engine SDK from http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html.  You
can then run the server using

  make serve

(assuming you're on Linux or Mac OS X).

The server is only accessible on http://localhost:8080.  The server in
the Google App Engine SDK is not designed for serving real traffic.
The App Engine FAQ at http://code.google.com/appengine/kb/general.html
says about this: "You can override this using the -a <hostname> flag
when running it, but doing so is not recommended because the SDK has
not been hardened for security and may contain vulnerabilities."

To deploy your own instance of the app to Google App Engine:

  1. Register your own application ID on the App Engine admin site.
  2. Edit app.yaml to use this app ID instead of 'codereview'.
  3. Upload using

    make update

*** Don't forget step 2!  If you forget to change the application ID,
you'll get a error message from "appcfg.py update" (called by "make
update") complaining you don't have the right to administer this app.
