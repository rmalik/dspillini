Bugs
----

If a user never logs in, someone else can grab their nickname
See the issue tracker at code.google.com/p/rietveld for more bugs

Data Cleaning
-------------

Email addresses should be lowercased before comparing
Nicknames too???
Nicknames should not be allowed to contain multiple internal spaces
    nor internal whitespace other than space

Issues
------

Archive issues (that's per user rather than per issue)

Patch Sets
----------

Edit patch set message
Delete patch sets

Repositories and Branches
-------------------------

Get rid of the repository feature in favor of always using upload.py?
Edit/Delete Repository?
Automatically add Repository entries when a new project uploads stuff?

Searching, Organizing
---------------------

View all open issues by base, or by repository
View all closed issues (issue 15 in the tracker)

Commenting
----------

Add stars
Add non-inline comments per file, per patchset, per issue

Diffs and Patches
-----------------

Deprecate the upload form (and repositories) and do it all with upload.py
Improve UI for selecting patch set deltas; handle missing files better
Syntax colorization
Record revision and show in UI; indicate action (add/edit/delete)
Handle binary files?!  (Progress: fewer crashes related to binary files)
Add line length option
Support more diff formats  (Better: let upload.py normlize these)
Need a more powerful way to specify the URL for finding a revision (?)

User Experience
---------------

Make Edit Issue show the form inline instead of opening a new page?
Fields "SVN Base" and "Base" have hard-to-guess names
Better UI for adding branches?  (Low priority now we have upload.py)
Right-justify the "Id" and "Drafts (mine)" headings in the Issues list table

Software Engineering
